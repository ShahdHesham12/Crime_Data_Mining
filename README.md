# Crime_Data_Mining

A data mining and machine learning project that analyzes real-world crime data to uncover patterns and make predictions. The project applies both unsupervised learning techniques—such as k-medoids and hierarchical clustering—and supervised learning models including Decision Tree and Random Forest classifiers to predict crime categories and understand key influencing factors.
The results are visualized and deployed through an interactive Streamlit app for easy exploration and interpretation.
